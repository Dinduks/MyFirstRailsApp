Exemple d'une application Ruby on Rails
=======================================
[![Travis](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Dinduks/MyFirstRailsApp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Dinduks/MyFirstRailsApp)

I have created this application while learning Ruby/RoR with @dmathieu as a teacher, and I decided to share it with my classmates and also those who want to get a quick idea of how a real RoR project looks like.

How to
------
* Clone this repository -- `git clone git://github.com/Dinduks/MyFirstRailsApp.git`
* Start the server -- `rails server`
* Run the migrations -- `rake db:migrate`
* Fill-in the database with example data -- `rake db:seed`
* Login as an admin -- Username: `samy@dindane.com`, Password: `samysawesome`
